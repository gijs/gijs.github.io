Framer employees, alongside committed community members, have jumped in and helped others tackle complex prototyping problems or quickly get up to speed with interactive design. We’ve shared, shaped, and riffed on everything from powerful components to fully realized design systems within the community.
Our communities, both in-person and online (like our Discord), have helped people grow their skills, connect with like-minded designers, and push the boundaries of prototyping.</description></item><item><title>Conceptual Integrity</title><link>http://gijs.github.io/2021/10/conceptual-integrity/</link><pubDate>Wed, 06 Oct 2021 18:25:57 +0200</pubDate><guid>http://gijs.github.io/2021/10/conceptual-integrity/</guid><description>In 1975, Fred Brooks said: I will contend that Conceptual Integrity is the most important consideration in system design. It is better to have a system omit certain anomalous features and improvements, but to reflect one set of design ideas, than to have one that contains many good but independent and uncoordinated ideas.
In 1995, Brooks still hasn&amp;rsquo;t changed his mind: I am more convinced than ever. Conceptual Integrity is central to product quality.</description></item><item><title>Fifth Post</title><link>http://gijs.github.io/2021/10/fifth-post/</link><pubDate>Wed, 06 Oct 2021 17:25:57 +0200</pubDate><guid>http://gijs.github.io/2021/10/fifth-post/</guid><description>That it will never come again Is what makes life so sweet.
