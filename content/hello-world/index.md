After writing on a regular basis between 2005 and 2018, I found myself spending more time on Twitter. But more so as a consumer than as a writer.

Perhaps I didn't write much because of the character limit, but the real reason is probably that everything is directly pushed to followers. 

A blog feels more calm to me. I don't have to worry about the content being too long, I can just write it and let the audience decide what to read.
