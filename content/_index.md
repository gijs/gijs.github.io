👋🏻 Good day!  I'm Gijs, a 40-something year old software developer from the Netherlands. I love to build enjoyable software, and I'm always looking for new challenges.

15+ years experience building interesting SaaS apps using boring web tech.

Master of Arts in Interaction Design from the [Utrecht School of the Arts](https://www.hku.nl).
