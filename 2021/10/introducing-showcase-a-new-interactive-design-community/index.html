<p class="text-gray-700 text-base leading-snug"><p>Community has always been a focus for Framer as a company and undoubtedly has made the tool what it is today. Framer employees, alongside committed community members, have jumped in and helped others tackle complex prototyping problems or quickly get up to speed with interactive design. We’ve shared, shaped, and riffed on everything from powerful components to fully realized design systems within the community.</p>
<p>Our communities, both in-person and online (like our Discord), have helped people grow their skills, connect with like-minded designers, and push the boundaries of prototyping. Today, we introduce a new space for our community, where you can share work, learn from what others create, and build up a collection of your best work.</p>
<h1 id=what-is-showcase>What is Showcase?</h1>
<p>Showcase is our new home for community-created interactive designs and prototypes. Browse this gallery to see the latest and greatest things made in Framer—from individual components with delightful micro-interactions to comprehensive app concepts with detailed user journeys.</p>

<p>Showcase gives contributors the chance to build up their own Framer design portfolio. Contributors get their own profile page where they can create a bio, link to other social profiles, and check out their all-time stats—views, likes, and opens.</p>

</div><p>Now, you can get your own unique Framer handle, too. Your unique handle connects to your profile page. This effectively gives you your own portfolio of interactive Framer designs on a unique URL, so it’s a great way to share your best work all in one place. You can claim your handle even before sharing a project, so get in quick to reserve yours!</p>
<p>Showcase isn’t just a place to browse and show off projects, though. It’s a whole new way to learn interactive design.</p>
<p>We believe in learning by doing, so we made it easy for everyone to open Showcase projects in Framer and learn from them. Simply click through to a project you like and click the Open in Framer button. This duplicates the project so you can pull it apart and learn how it works or iterate on it to create something new.</p>
<p>We asked a handful of designers to share their work while Showcase was in beta. Here are some of the projects that caught our team’s eye, plus a little about each creator and what the design community means to them.</p>
